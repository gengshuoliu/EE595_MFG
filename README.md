# Distributed Power Control Method for Ultra-dense D2D Communications in 5G/6G Networks
## Overview
In this project, we trained a neural operator to optimize power control for ultra-dense D2D communication in 5G/6G networks. We then developed a multithreaded C++ inference application backed by the neural operator. Please See the <a href="#">report</a> for details.
